# Data Analysis Fundamentals - Projects

## About

This repo contains all the guided projects based on the DataQuest.io Data Analyst in Python Path. It serves as part of Data Analyst(and hopefully, soon, Data Scientist) Portfolio, as well as a personal reference/cheat sheet in the future. And perhaps, to anyone who might might stumble upon this repo, I hope you may find it of use, as well.

All Datasets and Images taken from DataQuest.io
